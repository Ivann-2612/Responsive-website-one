			<h3 id='about'>So What is This About our services?</h3>
			<p>* Single Process: a single process is a color service done in one step. Usually used to cover greys or go darker. Can be used to go lighter in some cases but only if you have no color on your hair (this includes henna, colored conditioners, rinses, and glosses). Root retouch is just the roots, a full all-over color change may require extra time and charge. </p>
			<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">Full Head:</abbr> full head highlight service includes both balayage and traditional foil highlights. This service adds dimension all throughout the hair. Your stylist will consult with you to choose the best method for your hair goals. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="participation" id="zen-participation" role="article">
			<h3>Participation</h3>
			<p>* Half Head: balayage or foil highlights all over except for the back underneath portion of your hair,* Face Frame: balayage or foil highlights just around the face. </p>
			<p>* Gloss: also known as a toner. A non-permanent color that adds tone and shine. You can only go on level or darker than your current hair. Great for canceling out warmth on brassy highlights between services or refreshing your single process to be more rich or vibrant.</p>
			<p>The following services are not available for online booking because we prefer to do an email consultation or have a quick phone chat to make sure you are booking the correct service. 
				** Double Process: usually used to go a solid blonde all over. All the hair is bleached out and then a toner/gloss service is done on all the hair. 
				** Fantasy Color: all your blues, greens purples, pinks, etc. we can consult to figure out how much color you want to see and the placement of it to determine timing and technique.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits" id="zen-benefits" role="article">
			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>** Color Correction: if you have color on your hair already and want a significant change you may fit into this service. We will probably ask you to email us a photo of your current hair and your hair goals to let you know what’s possible to achieve. Usually takes multiple appointments to reach an ideal color. </p>
